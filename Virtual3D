#Virtual 3D

In this project, I will create a virtual three dimensional display using face tracking for head tracking. More specifically, I use Haar Cascade face tracker from OpenCV to determine a persons x,y,and z location relative to a webcam. I then update the display of a virtual tunnel according to the user's position so that it gives a 3D effect.
